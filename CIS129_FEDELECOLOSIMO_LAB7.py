#Step 1

    print("Enter a number:")
    number = int(input())
    number += 10
    return number
#Step 2

#Writing Your Own Function that Returns a Boolean Value
#Step 1
def gender():
    answer = False
    type = input("Enter your gender (male or female): ")
    if type == "male":
        answer = False
    else:
        answer = True
    return answer
#Step 2
answer = gender()

#Using Mathematical Library Function: sqrt
#Step 1
# Declare a variable named myNumber
myNumber = 0

# Declare a variable named squareRoot of the data type Real
squareRoot = 0.0

# Ask the user to enter a number and store it in myNumber
myNumber = float(input("Enter a number: "))

# Call the sqrt function to determine the square root of myNumber
squareRoot = math.sqrt(myNumber)

# Display the square root to the screen
print("The square root is", squareRoot)

#Using formatting Functions
#Step 1
Declare Real subtotal
Declare Constant Real tax = 0.06
Declare Real total

Display "Enter the subtotal:"
Input subtotal

Set total = subtotal + subtotal * tax

Display "The total is $", currencyFormat(total)
